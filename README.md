# Leetcode Problem Reference

This repository contains easy-to-read reference sheets for LeetCode problems that I solved in preparation of technical interviews for Meta, Amazon, Affirm, & WhatNot. These are intended to be learning/review materials for future techncial interviews. 

The process of arriving at the solution to each problem is broken down like so:
1. Intuition
2. Step-by-step Algorithm (Natural language)
3. Coded Solution
4. Complexity Analysis

**How to Use:**

Attempt solving problems on your own as much as possible. When stuck, reference the breakdown in the order provided, but only look at the step you're stuck at and go back to solving on your own. Resist looking at the coded solution off the bat.

**Topic Order:**

1. [Arrays & Hashmaps](arrays-and-hashmaps)
2. [Two Pointers](two-pointers)
3. [Sliding Window](sliding-window)
4. [Binary Search](binary-search)
5. [Linked Lists](linked-lists)
6. [Stacks & Queues](stacks-and-queues)
7. [Binary Trees](binary-trees)
8. [Binary Search Trees](binary-search-trees)
9. [Heaps](heaps)
